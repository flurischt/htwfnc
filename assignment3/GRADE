TOTAL: 85.00 / 100.00

Ex 1) 10 / 12
(b) Effective bits for cache are related to RAM size. 
Ex 2) 12 OK
Ex 3) 20 OK
Ex 4) 17
(a) 0.5/0.5
(b) 0.5/0.5
(c) 8/8
(d) 8/8
(e) 0/8 wrong conclusion + calculation, columns of A are loaded according to k which changes every iteration
5) 21
(a) From Tmem=Tcomp follows that the op.int. is in ridge position. To actually place the dot on the ridge we need perfect overlap between Tcomp and Tmem (-5).
(b) Note: “by a factor O(alpha^2)” is not correct (you would allow nonquadratic factors as well). “A factor alpha^2” is good enough.
