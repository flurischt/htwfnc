TOTAL:  77.50 / 100.00

Ex1) 15p
Ex 4) 5+5+5+0=15
(d) Drops due to cache effect not explained correctly
Ex 3) 13.5/15
(b) 3/3
(d) 3/3 + 3/3 + 3/3 for the plots
(e) 1.5/3 the effect of cache on performance is hinted but not mentioned explicitly, no explanation as to why peak performance cannot be reached?
Ex 5) 5+2+0+0 = 7 / 20
(c) i. What about ILP ? Your solution can be simply disproven by simple benchmark.
ii. Incorrect. See solution.
